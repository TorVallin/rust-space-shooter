# rust-space-shooter
A simple Galaga-like game implemented in Rust using the Bevy game engine. The game was just made to test out Bevy before making a large project using the engine, and little to no time was spent polishing the gameplay or the visuals.

## Running the project
Compile with `cargo`, the project should compile on any operating system that Bevy compiles on.
```
cargo run
```
